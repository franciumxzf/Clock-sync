## Clock-sync

freqdetuneg2: generate_freqdetuneg2.py generates c1.dat, c4eX.dat from singletimestampnodelay.a1.dat, with the PNG illustrating the original peak and time delay (-14ns)\
simulation: some primary work trying to understand the working principle of pfind\
simulate_pfind: an improved version of simulation, try to test the algorithm with some data generated with random numbers; at this step, we tried to deal with the frequency shift, however, due to the memory limit, we didn't observe a good performance of this algorithm\
time_freq: a primary algorithm from the paper that can deal with the real timestamp data (need to use parse_timestamp.py), performance tbc.
